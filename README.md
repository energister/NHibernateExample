NHibernateExample
=================

This is example of how to work with database relations (objects associations) using NHibernate.

There are 3 types of associations Nhibernate supports (with a few subtypes):
* one-to-one (use PRIMARY KEY)
* one-to-many (use FOREIGN KEY)
* many-to-many

This example also demonstrates usage of lazy loading options
